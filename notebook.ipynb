There are some places that get more than 1500 sales but this is very uncommon.\n\nWhen looking for places that have high sales, the team should aim for locations having over 1500 sales, but be aware there may need to work with 1000 sales or more.\n \n![t2](t2.png)\n","metadata":{},"id":"8fcff247-db49-42c0-8710-51848aeb6347","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Task 4","metadata":{},"id":"c5fbe3a0-d277-437c-a1a0-f1edf80684f7","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## **Describe the relationship between repeat purchases and sales.

So far pet stores with over 1000 sales would be ideal, there’s need to look at the two variables together to see if this is realistic.\n\n![t4a](t4a.png)\n\nWhen looking at just the sales, we excluded a single outlying value so that we could see the majority of the data. To show the impact, we can look at the range of number of sales by purchase with this outlier in the data. In the graphic above, you can see that this outlier is dominating the data and making comparison difficult. To make it easier to compare the rest of the data, we will remove this outlier.\n\n![t4b](t4b.png)\n\nAfter we removed the outliers, we can focus on the main range of data. Although pet purchases include the sales with the highest kind of purchases, the interquartile range of the sales on one-off purchases (0) is lower than that of the repeated purchases (1). This would suggest that the majority of the number of sales may be higher if customers make repeated purchases. However, this could also be an effect of having the largest number of repeated purchase, so the large number of repeated purchase can bring the median low.\n","metadata":{},"id":"170dd2ea-340f-4ab4-94c8-fe077342e98e","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## ✅ When you have finished...\n-  Publish your Workspace using the option on the left\n-  Check the published version of your report:\n\t-  Can you see everything you want us to grade?\n    -  Are all the graphics visible?\n-  Review the grading rubric.
